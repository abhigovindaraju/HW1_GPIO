# HW1_GPIO
HW1: c code timing analysis Part I |-  http://developer.mbed.org/platforms/mbed-LPC1768/ |-  skip reading: schematics and data sheets |-  write a C program to toggle a assigned GPIO output pin (lookup yours from Grades sheet) |- use objdump to lookup machine code |- use ARM data sheet to decode machine code |- write a page report (include hours that you spend in the homework.)
